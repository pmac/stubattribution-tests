# stubattribution-tests

Placeholder repo, for now, to capture and hopefully develop load and automated functional tests for the [Stub Attribution service] (https://github.com/mozilla-services/stubattribution).

Currently, this set of tests uses a real browser (Google Chrome), through (Sauce Labs)[https://saucelabs.com/], with real end-user actions, and gets us all the way up to, **but not including** downloading/running/verifying the stub-installer build.
