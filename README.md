# stubattribution-tests
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephendonner/stubattribution-tests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephendonner/stubattribution-tests)

Placeholder repo, for now, to capture and hopefully develop load and automated functional tests for the [Stub Attribution service] (https://github.com/mozilla-services/stubattribution).

Currently, this set of tests uses a real browser (Google Chrome), through [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/), with real end-user actions, and gets us all the way up to, **but not including** downloading/running/verifying the stub-installer build.
